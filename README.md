# Open AI ChatBot

## How To Use
Simply download using either `git clone` or download as ZIP and extract.  
Then navigate to the directory and run `dotnet run`. In the build directory  
there should be a OpenAIToken.txt file. This is where you put your OpenAI  
API key. You can get one [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).
